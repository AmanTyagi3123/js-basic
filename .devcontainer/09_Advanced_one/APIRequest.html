    XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in.
    0 -> UNSENT -> client has been created. open() not called yet.
    1 -> OPENED -> open() has been called.
    2 -> HEADERS_RECEIVED -> send() has been called, and headers and status are available
    3 -> LOADING -> Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
    4 -> DONE -> The operation is complete.

    // A very interesting fact is that console.log which we use quiet often is a dev tool but not real part of Js.
    // Actually, one of the many engines used to implement JS, V8 engine, has a d8 folder in which the implementation
    // of JS is done using cpp. This is a very interesting thing to know as I was very keen on knowing that how JS was
    // implemented and knowing that it was implemented using my favourite language cpp is extremely delightful.
